# JAMMING React app nÂ°1

This app has been created within the online course Codecademy.com _Career Path Front-End Engineer_.

Code formation was mostly accompanied by the course solution. Because of some bugs in the course hierarchy, it made me to do this project before study of the essentiel React topics, so it was kind of punk creation, that needed a lot of support.

That is the reason of used kind of _styling_. At this time, I would choose the use of styles modules.
